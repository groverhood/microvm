# MicroVM

### About
MicroVM is a CPU emulation application that currently ships with an assembler. What makes this project
unique is that much of it is generated by scripts that use a JSON file as a template for structuring
the datapath, instruction set, and the CPU state. The end goal for this project is trifold:
  
  1. Accurately and efficiently emulate a single CPU.
  2. Ship with an assembler and a fully-fledged C compiler that can allow for the simple compilation
  of C sources and transpilation of Assembly sources to run on the application.
  3. Accomplish the previous goals while having most of the native C code generated, allowing for simple,
  high level, and efficient development.
  
### Structure
Currently, the project is split into the generated/handwritten header files, Python scripts that generate
the former, and C sources. Building the project is as simple as entering the command `$ bash build.sh`.
Developers have access to the generated scripts as commands store in their local bin directory.
